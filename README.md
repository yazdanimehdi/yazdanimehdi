### 🧬 About Me

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida, working at the intersection of **machine learning**, **computational drug discovery**, and **bioinformatics**. My research focuses on building robust, symmetry-aware models for biological sequence modeling, particularly in the context of **mRNA**, **drug-target interaction**, and **fairness in AI systems**.

### 🧪 Research Highlights

- **HELM** (ICLR 2025): Developed the first hierarchical mRNA language model, improving antibody prediction by 8%.
- **FragXsiteDTI** (NeurIPS 2024): Transformer-based model for interpreting drug-target binding sites.
- **FairBiNN** (NeurIPS 2024): Bilevel optimization for balancing accuracy and fairness in neural networks.
- **DeepDrugDomain**: Toolkit for standardizing datasets and benchmarks in drug discovery tasks.
- **Equi-mRNA** (under review): Group-theoretic model for codon embeddings and equivariant mRNA generation.
